My name is Michal and I am a graduate student studying Imaging Science at RIT, having previously graduated with a double major in Applied Math and Microelectronic Engineering from RIT as well.

This blog will mostly serve as a place, where I can document and share my thoughts regarding small projects I undertake. The topics will likely include (but not limited to  and more likely to expand in future): Kaggle competitions, Deep Learning, Python.
